# Carly-s-Clippers
This project analyzes service and revenue data for Carly’s Clippers, a new hair salon. As the data analyst, I worked with three parallel lists:  hairstyles – names of the haircuts offered  prices – current price for each haircut  last week – number of times each style was purchased in the last week

# Hair Salon Revenue Analysis

A concise Python project that analyzes weekly haircut prices and revenue for a fictional hair salon.  
It showcases core Python skills such as loops, list comprehensions, and simple data analysis.

## Project Overview
- **Price Analysis**  
  Calculates the total and average haircut price, then creates a discounted price list with a $5 reduction for each style.

- **Revenue Calculation**  
  Computes total weekly revenue using the number of customers for each style and determines the average daily revenue.

- **Marketing Insights**  
  Identifies which haircuts remain under $30 after the discount, providing data-driven ideas for targeted promotions.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Fundamentals**: `for` loops, `range()`, conditionals, and list comprehensions.
- **Data Handling**: Working with multiple related lists and combining their information.
- **Readable Code**: Clear variable names and logical structure that are easy to follow.

This project highlights the ability to write clean, organized Python code and extract actionable business insights from simple data.
